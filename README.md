# CS330 Computer Graphics and Visualization

1.  How do I approach designing software?
      What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
      What design process did you follow for your project work?
      How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

I work in a systematic approach, understanding the goal, requirements, resources, information and any blockers that may impede my ability to move forward.  I develop in iterations, accomplish subsets of functionality before moving onto the next piece, which ensures that I'm able to make some progress at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish the entire project in one go of it.  This approach is repeatable and easy to understand and can be taught to others.
  
2.  How do I approach developing programs?
      What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
      How did iteration factor into your development?
      How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

Accomplishing one element or piece as often as I can eventually equates to completely the project as a whole.  Understanding the most fundamental aspects of a project helped me backtrack in the event of any hinderances, which then led me to being able to either find workarounds or to correct mistakes found within the code base.  Utilizing milestones emphasizes this process, as we complete sections of the program and its functionality, then add on to it later, increasing the complexity and the need to understand the basic fundamentals of the program.

  
3.  How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
      How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
      How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Understanding what can be accomplished, how to execute and the tools required to do such tasks has opened my eyes to an entirely new world of development.  Although I'm not professionally involved within the space of this type of development, if adds value to my skillsets and understanding of the field and should I need to call on those skills in the future, I know exactly what needs to be done.
